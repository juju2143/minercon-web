minercon-web is a simple web interface to Minecraft's remote console, so you can remotely admin your Minecraft server without messing with SSH and screen.

Usage
=====

To install this, you'll need a simple Apache+PHP server or hosting. Dump the files in a folder of your document root and voilÃ .
You also must have enable-rcon=true and rcon.password set in your server's server.properties.

Server: Input the IP or hostname of your server, with optionally the port.
Examples:
> 192.168.1.2
> mc.example.net
> mc.example.net:25575

Password: The password you defined in rcon.password. Notice that you can't see what you're typing, not even stars, as most UNIX systems does.

rcon>: You're ready to type your commands in. If you're confused, you can always type "help". You can logout by reloading the page.
